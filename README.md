This is a single-page mapping app. It doesn't have any local resources so opening it won't require a local server, but will require an internet connection. 

This map describes the specimens of fungi collected by a boy, Calvin, around Pittsburgh. Each specimen is of a certain species, and detailed information about that species is fetched from wikipedia.
